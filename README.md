# Flashcord Legacy
## This is ![Flashcord](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord) but worse.
##### but also way less bloated technically
This is what Flashcord orginally was: this is practically the first version ever. It never was released to the public until the new Flashcord rewrite took place 2 years later.

Light theme only with an eye watering nearly-impossible to see pink accent color. This version of Flashcord truly brings the Flash in Flashcord. You will get Flashbanged no matter how hard you try to hide from it.

### WARNING: This theme uses margins in animations when it shouldn't. If you wondered why [FC-ChatSlide_Legacy](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Flashcord-Modules#--flashcore-chatslide-modules) exists, now you know.
#### ⚠️ This theme will bring any CPU down its knees. Using Flashcord Legacy on a low-end pc is like trying to P-Rank Ultrakill's P-2 level with only your fists all of that while an Idol'd Minos Prime is constantly trying to scream judgment at you.
